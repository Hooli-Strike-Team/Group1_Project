Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
    
    Logic Tutor is a computer-assisted training app to improve logic and critical thinking skills, tutoring the user on advanced strategies in classic logic games like chess and sudoku. The app presents real-time strategic hints from the computer to advance the user's game strategy, and tracks learning progress using real-time automated tools.

  
Motivation: why are you working on this project?

    1.) The project accommodates the varied skill sets and experience levels of the Hooli-Strike Team. 
        It also offers ample opportunity for team members to expand their programming knowledge.
       
    2.) Logic games such as Sudoku and Chess are difficult to master on oneâ€™s own. Computer-assisted
        learning technologies help users to improve their problem-solving abilities and use specialized
        tools to provide them with instant feedback, progress tracking, and achievement features.
        

Risks to project completion; possibly including new language or working environment no prior experience working with 
these team members, lack of some needed resources, etc:
        
    -Team member schedule conflicts
    
    -Lack of familiarity with front-end game development
        
    -Lack of experience or familiarity with certain logic games
        
    -Difficulties agreeing on requirements, features, and timelines of completion

        
Mitigation Strategy for above risks (Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!)
        
    1.) Agile-Scrum: weekly sprints, design meetings, review and team retrospective meetings.
        
    2.) Pair-Programming: meeting in pairs to work on sections of the project.
        
    3.) Test-Driven Development: writing tests that demonstrate satisfactory performance with respect to user requirements.
