## User_Account Table ##
### 'User_Account' Table Description ###

    Name: 
        User_Account
    Description:
        User_Account holds user data tuples containing the attributes: 'Username', 'Password', 'First_Name', 'Last_Name', and 'Email'. 
        The User_Account table will be populated via a form submission route associated with the Create Account page.
        Username and Password are stored and verified within this table to grant users access to the rest of the application.
    Field Descriptions:
        Username, VARCHAR(32) - Primary Key
        Password, VARCHAR(16) - NOT NULL
        First_Name, VARCHAR(50) - NOT NULL
        Last_Name, VARCHAR(50) - NOT NULL
        Email, VARCHAR(320) - UNIQUE, NOT NULL
    Tests for Table Verification:
        (see below)
#### 'User_Account' Table Test 1 Description ####

        User_Account Test 1: Create the User_Account table, insert a valid record, verify the insertion.
        Use case name:
            "Create Table / Valid Insert"
        Description:
            Create the User_Account table and insert a valid record. Then retrieve the record(s) to verify the insertion.
        Pre-conditions
            The User_Account table must be created prior to performing the test.
            User_Account table constraints must be in place.
            Inserted data must agree with the table constraints.
        Test steps:
            1. Create the User_Account table (if it does not already exist).
            2. Insert a tuple of valid test data. I.e., following the table constraints given above.
            3. '''SELECT * FROM User_Account''' to view the data and verify that the record has been inserted.
        Expected result:
            The inserted tuple should be clearly visible in the result of the SELECT query.
        Actual result:
            Table insert qualities were tested and confirmed using an ipynb notebook. (See Test_Cases/DB_Controller.ipynb)
        Status (Pass/Fail):
            Pass
        Notes:
            Test 
        Post-conditions:
            Tuple exists in the User_Account table.
#### 'User_Account' Table Test 2 Description ####

        User_Account Test 2: Insertion of a record with a duplicate Username.
        Use case name:
            "Duplicate Record Insert"
        Description:
            Inserting a record containing a duplicate Username into the User_Account table should fail.
        Pre-conditions:
            The User_Account table must exist.
            User_Account table constraints must be in place.
            Inserted record must contain a Username that already exists in the User_Account table.
        Test steps:
            1. Ensure that at least one valid tuple is inserted in the User_Account table.
            2. Insert a tuple containing the same Username as one of the valid record(s) from step 1.
            3. Observe the result.
        Expected result:
            An error should occur, citing a violation of the User_Account table primary key constraint on Username.
        Actual result:
            Table insert qualities were tested and confirmed using an ipynb notebook. (See Test_Cases/DB_Controller.ipynb)
        Status (Pass/Fail):
            Pass
        Notes:
            Insertion of a duplicate username should be rejected by the database API if the table constraints have been implemented correctly. Observe the API behavior during this insertion and consider this information when developing the User_Account access routes. 
        Post-conditions:
            None.
#### 'User_Account' Table Test 3 Description ####

        User_Account Test 3: Insertion of a record with a duplicate email address.
        Use case name:
            "Existing Email Insert"
        Description:
            Attempting to create an account with an existing email address should fail.
        Pre-conditions:
            The User_Account table must exist, with stated table constraints in place.
            User_Account table should be populated with valid record(s) prior to performing the test.
            Other than the Email parameter, the test record should contain valid user data.
        Test steps:
            1. Create a test record that contains an existing email address. (All other attributes should conform to the User_Account table constraints.)
            2. Insert the record.
            3. Observe the result.
        Expected result:
            An error should occur, citing a violation of the User_Account UNIQUE table constraint on the 'Email' attribute.
        Actual result:
            Table insert qualities were tested and confirmed using an ipynb notebook. (See Test_Cases/DB_Controller.ipynb)
        Status (Pass/Fail):
            Pass
        Notes:
            Insertion of a duplicate email should be rejected by the database API if the table constraints have been implemented correctly. Observe the API behavior during this insertion and consider this information when developing the User_Account access routes.
        Post-conditions:
            None.

### 'User_Account' Access Method Descriptions ###

#### Method 1: The 'Create_User_Account' Access Method ####

    Name: 
        'Create_User_Account'
    Description:
        Create_User_Account should insert a tuple filled with new user data into the User_Account table when the user fills in the Create Account form with valid information and clicks the submit button. If the insert is valid with respect to the stated table constraints, the user should be directed to the Login page.
        If the user attempts to create an account with an existing Username or Email, no new record shall be created, and a message should be presented to the user on the same page explaining the error.
    Parameters:
        Username, Password, First_Name, Last_Name, Email, Create Account button
    Return values:  
        User is directed to the Login page if correct information was provided.
        Error message is displayed if Username exists in the table.
        Error message is displayed if Email exists in the table.
    List of tests for verifying the access method: 
        'Create_User_Account' Test 1:
            Use case name:
                "Create Valid Account"
            Description:
                Verify that entering valid form data into the "Create Account" page produces a new record in the User_Account table and redirects the user to the Login page. Inserted data must remain in the table for access by subsequent routes. Entries containing duplicate Username and/or Email should fail to produce a new record and render the initial view along with an appropriate error message.
            Pre-conditions:
                The User_Account table must exist with stated constraints.
                The Username test instance must not exist in User_Account.
                The Email test instance must not exist in User_Account.
                Password, First_Name, and Last_Name must be provided. 
            Test steps:
                1. Navigate to 'Create an Account' page
                2. Provide a unique username (required)
                3. Provide a password (required)
                4. Provide a first name (required)
                5. Provide a last name (required)
                6. Provide a unique email address (required)
                7. Click the 'Create Account' button
                8. Observe the application behavior and monitor any changes to the User_Account table.
                9. Repeat steps 1-8 with a record containing a duplicate Username.
                10. Repeat steps 1-8 with a record containing a duplicate Email.
                11. Repeat steps 1-8 with a record containing a duplicate Username and Email.
            Expected result:
                Steps 1-8: A tuple should appear in the User_Account table containing the new user's data if table constraints were observed. Upon successful account creation, the user should be directed to the 'Login' page.
                Steps 9-11: If the inserted record contains a duplicate Username, Email, or both, then no new record should be inserted into User_Account, and the user should be prompted on the same page to try again (i.e., no redirect).
            Actual result:
                Inserts into the database from the create account page were tested and confirmed in the ipynb notebook prior to integration. (See Test_Cases/DB_Controller.ipynb) Tests for page redirection and form behavior all passed, with the exception of an error message (which was not implemented during this sprint). 
            Status (Pass/Fail):
                Pass
            Notes:
                Since the user must create an account to possess valid login credentials, it makes sense to perform this test before testing the User_Account interactions with Login page (discussed next). Attempts to add an account under an existing email address and/or Username should fail gracefully and present the user with a message describing the error.
            Post-conditions:
                Valid account records must persist in the User_Account table to provide record access to subsequent routes. 

#### Method 2: The 'User_Login' Access Method ####

    Name: 
        'User_Login'
    Description:
        The User_Login access method should verify that the user's login credentials exist in the User_Account table and, if so, redirect the user to the user's home page. 
        If the provided information is incorrect or does not exist in the User_Account table, the login attempt should fail, and the user should be presented with an error message in place of a redirect.
    Parameters:
        Username, Password, Login Button
    Return values:
        Redirect to Home page if credentials are successfully verified.
        Present an error message if credentials are incorrect and/or do not exist.
    List of tests for verifying each access method: 
        User_Login Test 1:
        Use case name:
            "Test Login"
        Description:
            Verify that a user with valid login credentials is granted access to the rest of the application. 
            Verify that a incorrect and/or empty login credentials do NOT provide access to the rest of the application.
        Pre-conditions:
            At least one user must be registered via the 'Create Account' page to provide a set of valid login credentials.
        Test steps:
            1. Navigate to the Login page.
            2. Provide valid user name.
            3. Provide valid password.
            4. Click 'Sign In' button.
            5. Observe the behavior of the application.
            6. Repeat steps 1-5 using an invalid username and correct password.
            7. Repeat steps 1-5 using an invalid password and correct username.
            8. Repeat steps 1-5 using an valid username and empty password field.
            9. Repeat steps 1-5 using an valid password and empty username field.
            10. Repeat steps 1-5 with an empty username and password field.
        Expected result:
            Steps 1-5: If a valid Username and Password combination is provided, clicking 'Sign In' button should invoke a redirect to the user's home page.
            Steps 6-10: If a faulty Username/Password combination is provided, the rendered view should not change and a message should appear describing the error. 
        Actual result:
            Inserts into the database from the create account page were tested and confirmed in the ipynb notebook prior to integration. (See Test_Cases/DB_Controller.ipynb) Tests for page redirection and form behavior all passed, with the exception of an error message (which was not implemented during this sprint). 
        Status (Pass/Fail):
            Pass
        Notes:
            All attempts to login with invalid username and password combination should fail. Fixed length form fields and user input screening should be implemented when designing the route to eliminate the possibility of an SQL injection attack. 
        Post-conditions:
            User is directed to the game page upon successful login. 
            Login page is rendered with appropriate error message after a failed login attempt.
